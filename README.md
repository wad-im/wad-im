### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wadim.

I develop and built websites and web apps for fun after I started self-teaching front-end development in the beginning of COVID-19 in 2020.

My journey into front-end began with tutorials at [Superhi](https://www.superhi.com/), because the design angle made the world of front-end initially more accessible for me. ðŸ‘‰ [Repo](https://github.com/wad-im/superhi)

Today, I built with React, Gatsbyjs (a little bit nextjs), styled-components (a little tailwindcss, materialui), typescript, figma for design, and experimented with different apis, and ventured a little into backend with serverless functions (gatsby functions, netlify functions), and some databases (supabase, firebase, airtable). 

I invite you to check out the different repos, e.g.

- my little blog [wadimbaslow.com](https://wadimbaslow.com/) ðŸ‘‰ [Repo](https://github.com/wad-im/wadim-on-the-internet)
- [Quercus Group's Website](https://quercus-group.com/) ðŸ‘‰ private repo
- the conference website [Innovate4WASH](https://innovate4wash.quercus-group.com/) with registration, authentication, payment with stripe ðŸ‘‰ [Repo](https://github.com/wad-im/innovate4wash)

Say hi at hello@wadimbaslow.com. I'm looking for freelance opportunities or even shifting the profession [my Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wbaslow/).

Thank you,
Wadim
